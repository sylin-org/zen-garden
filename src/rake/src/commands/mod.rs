//! Command implementations for garden-rake
//!
//! This module contains the command handlers extracted from main.rs
//! for better separation of concerns and testability.
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! Commands implement the `Command` trait which provides:
//! - `execute()` - The command's business logic
//! - `requires_endpoint()` - Whether stone resolution is needed
//! - `show_stone_header()` - Whether to show stone banner
//!
//! The dispatcher handles common pre/post logic:
//! - Endpoint resolution (if required)
//! - Stone header display
//! - Suggestion printing
//!
//! ## Module Structure
//! - `help` - Command catalog and help display
//! - `admin/` - take-root, install-service
//! - `discovery/` - observe, watch, list, status
//! - `lifecycle/` - offer, rest, wake, remove, upgrade
//! - `adoption/` - adopt, release, borrow, return, find
//! - `management/` - tend, reconcile, refresh, pond, place, invite, lift, make
