//! Periodic announcement task
//!
//! Runs in background, announcing stone presence every 30 seconds.
//! Uses change detection to minimize unnecessary network traffic.
//!
//! Design:
//! - Simple interval loop (KISS)
//! - No complex state management (YAGNI)
//! - Delegates to announcement module (SoC)
